# How to run _aes_chisel_ tests?

This repository can be overwhelming when getting started. There's just so much code and so many dependencies! This
is why these instructions were created.

## Method 1: Run the provided script

We, the author(s), provide a linux terminal script that executes all available tests, one by one. Thus, to run
all tests, just run:

    ./aes_tests.sh > log.txt
The test run details will be stored in the _log.txt_ file.

Easy, right!? If you want to make sure that all the test files are generated from scratch, you can delete the directory
before running the tests.

    rm -r test_run_dir
Running all tests can take a while, but it's a simple method to check all modules.

## Method 2: Run with _sbt_

Each test file (see _src/test/scala/aes/_) can be run with _sbt_ by executing

    sbt 'testOnly aes.ModuleNameTester'
For example:

    sbt 'testOnly aes.AddRoundKeyTester'
    sbt 'testOnly aes.SubBytesTester'
This will run all the available tests for that module. If you would like to run a specific test,
add _-- -z_ plus a keyword available in the test description. Example:

    sbt 'testOnly aes.CipherTester -- -z verbose'
