# Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/)


## Motivation
* Equip developers with ready-to-use, parameterizable, encryption macros
* Compare performance, area, and power, of generated HDL with pure Verilog

## Features
* (more to come)
* Compact AES Cipher and Inverse Cipher Chisel implementation
* IDE (IntelliJ) environment for Scala and Chisel

## Instructions
* Generated Verilog will be in directory _/test_run_dir_

## References
* This project was created using the [chisel-template](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template) from [freechipsproject](https://github.com/freechipsproject)
* Best resource for learning Chisel: [chisel-bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp)
* Useful and highly recommeded [Scala class on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
