# Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/)


## Motivation
* Equip developers with ready-to-use, parameterizable, encryption macros
* Compare performance, area, and power, of generated HDL with pure Verilog

## Features
* (more to come)
* Compact AES Cipher and Inverse Cipher Chisel implementation
* IDE (IntelliJ) environment for Scala and Chisel

## Instructions
* Generated Verilog will be in directory _/test_run_dir_
* Either [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) or [dinotrace](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/dinotrace) (or other wave viewer) can be used to display _.vcd_ files
