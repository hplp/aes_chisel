# Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/)
=======================

## Motivation
* Provide a chisel implementation of the cipher that can be used in other projects
* Compare performance, area, and power, of generated HDL with pure Verilog

## Features
* (more to come)
* IDE (eclipse) environment for Scala and Chisel

## Instructions
* Generated Verilog will be in directory _/test_run_dir_

## References
* This project was created using the [chisel-template](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-template) from [ucb-bar](https://github.com/ucb-bar)
* Useful and highly recommeded [Scala class on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
